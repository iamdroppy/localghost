        <h1>Welcome to localghost.me!</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a project for local deployments. All subdomains from this domain (<a href='http://sample.localghost.me'>http://sample.localghost.me</a>) are pointed to <b>ALIAS</b> 127.0.0.1 .</p>
        <h2>But why? I can use /etc/hosts or something else!</h2>
        <p>Yes, indeed! You can use cusom DNS, hosts, or anything, but you won't have SSL! Every 3 months I renew the SSL and make it available here, so you can download and use localhost with SSL for local development.</p>
        <p>Many softwares require you to use HTTPs for deployment and this is a very simple solution. You can do it yourself if you like but I have taken the liberty of doing this for the community</p>
        <p>It points only the root-level sub-domains.</p>
        <p><b>Do not trust the SSL!</b> this is for PRIVATE deployments, and you can't make it available to the public.</p>
        <h2>Right and where's the SSL?</h2>
        <p>The SSL is generated by <a href='https://letsencrypt.org/'>Let's Encrypt</a> and is available here: <a href='https://letsencrypt.org/certs/sample.localghost.me.pem'>https://letsencrypt.org/</a>, right here:</p>
